# Arduino IoT Training using UNO with WiFiShield

This code is for MQTT connection using Arduino UNO with ESP8266 Cytron WiFi Shield to HiveMQ MQTT public broker. This training will use Arduino UNO with Node-RED as an IoT middleware to communicate with Telegram, Web Dashboard and MySQL database.

## The hardware used here are :

1. Arduino UNO.
2. Cytron Technologies WiFi ESP8266 shield.
3. Temperature sensor: LM35

## Libraries used :

1. PubSubClient : https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
2. Arduino JSON : https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson

HiveMQ MQTT is used as public broker (https://www.hivemq.com).
